# Are you interested in moving Flow forward? 
Hi! We are the creators of Flow. As you may have noticed it is no longer under active development because we both joined Instana (http://instana.com). 

**We are looking for an organization or people who would like to keep this tool alive.** Please get in touch with us if you are interested or have questions: contact@findtheflow.io.

We would like to sincerely thank you and the thousands of other developers who gave Flow a try and gave us some invaluable feedback.
